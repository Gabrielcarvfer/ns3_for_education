    "The application layer is where applications such as web browsers, games, office suites, banking  services, etc, generate and consume payloads that will be transported by the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transport layer acts as an intermediate between the application and the underlying network, implementing basic services/protocols or more complex ones, that try to offer more guarantees to the application, such as error checking and automatic retransmission, automatic ordering, etc. Packets that arrive or leave the transport layer have source and destination ports, that identify which process at the sender and the receiver are trying to communicate across a network route composed of many links.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network layer implements logical routes. These routes are based on forwarding packets from one network node to another, connected by a physical link. These packet forwardings are also known as hops, which are limited via a counter called Time-To-Live (TTL). When TTL reaches 0, the packet is discarded, and the original sender retransmits it (in case it is using a reliable transport protocol).\n",

    "\n",
    "The physical medium, or part of its capacity to transmit data, is typically referred to as a channel. The channel may have different capacities depending on the medium properties. Optical fiber, for example, is far less susceptible to interference, allowing for much higher capacity than copper, especially in long links, such as the submarine cables that connect countries and continents to a single global internet.\n",
